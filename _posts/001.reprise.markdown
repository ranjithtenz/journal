title: Reprise - A Minimalistic Blog
---
I [published][1] my newly written blog software yesterday which was featured on
[Ruby Inside][2] today. My aim for this little piece of software was to allow
me to publish blog entries with as little overhead as possible:

* Write entries using my favorite editor.
* Write in markdown syntax.
* No comments.
* No pingbacks.
* No categories.
* No tags.
* No archives.
* Just entries.

Usage can me summarized in five steps:

1. gem install sinatra haml bluecloth rubypants -y
2. wget redflavor.com/reprise.rb
3. mkdir entries
4. vi entries/YYYY.MM.DD.Title.Goes.Here
5. ruby reprise.rb

Thanks to a suggestion from Sime Ramov it now supports proper apostrophes, em
dashes and the likes by using [RubyPants][3]. I also went ahead and added hAtom
support enabling [syndication][4] by using [third party parsers][5]. Lastly I
added [CSS3 multi column][6] support for Firefox and Webkit browsers.
