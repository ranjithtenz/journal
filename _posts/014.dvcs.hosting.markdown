title: Private DVCS Hosting
---
While using [Github][github-profile] and [Bitbucket][bitbucket-profile]
for hosting and collaborating on open source projects is great--and not
to mention free of charge--I have several repositories with personal and
client related code which needs to stay private (like [wasitup][]'s source).
Most of these repositories
are quite small, weighing in under one megabyte. I quickly realized that I
had reached the maximum number of private repositories on Github and Bitbucket
for my plan while using less then one percent of my alloted disk space.

I'm equally satisfied with using Git and Mercurial--both have their own
strong and weak points--so I went out and searched for alternatives
offering support for one or both of these
<abbr title="Distributed Version Control Systems">DVCS</abbr>s.

Please note that this is a fairly high level overview of DVCS hosting
providers where I focused mainly on price for private repositories and
allocated disk space. When selecting a provider you should probably
take a closer look at how easy its offering is to use, how stable
and available it is, and that it provides the features you need.

Note that all mentions of repository count (including all values in the
"Repos" column in the following tables) are referring to private repos only,
not public repos.

### Git and Mercurial

A few providers supports both Git and Mercurial repositories. While support
for both of my favored DVCSs is convenient, there is a possibility that the
lack of focus on one system results in a less integrated user experience.

#### [Codebase][]

A fairly polished interface with a repository browser, ticketing with
milestones, time tracking, and wikis.

<table>

    <td style="background: #fbe3e4;">15.44</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Small</td>

    <td>2GB</td>
    <td>$20.06</td>

    <td>$61.73</td>
    <td style="background: #e6efc2;">0</td>
    <td>6.17</td>
  </tr>
</table>

In Codebase one *project* can have several repositories.
While all plans allow for an unlimited number of private repositories,
there are restrictions on how many *active projects* are allowed. The
parenthesized numbers in the "Repos" column represents this limitation.
One can have an unlimited amount of *archived projects* though.

The free Codebase account don't support time tracking and wikis, only
the repository browser and ticket system are usable.

#### [Repository Hosting][]

Uses the popular [Trac][] open source project management tool with
[several plugins][trac-plugins] (e.g. time tracking, agile workflow). Offers
daily [backups directly to your own S3 account][s3-backup].

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Repos</th>
    <th>Storage</th>
    <th>Monthly cost</th>
    <th>$/repo</th>
    <th>$/GB</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>&#8734;</td>
    <td>2GB</td>
    <td>$6</td>
    <td style="background: #e6efc2;">0</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Repository Hosting offers a single plan. If you need to grow, 1GB of
additional storage is $1 per month:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Repos</th>
    <th>Storage</th>
    <th>Monthly cost</th>
    <th>$/repo</th>
    <th>$/GB</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>&#8734;</td>
    <td>6GB</td>
    <td>$10</td>
    <td style="background: #e6efc2;">0</td>
    <td style="background: #e6efc2;">1.67</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>&#8734;</td>
    <td>16GB</td>
    <td>$20</td>
    <td style="background: #e6efc2;">0</td>
    <td style="background: #e6efc2;">1.25</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>&#8734;</td>
    <td>46GB</td>
    <td>$50</td>
    <td style="background: #e6efc2;">0</td>
    <td style="background: #e6efc2;">1.09</td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### [Assembla][]

When creating a new Assembla *space* you have to select from various preset
configurations or build your own by selecting various tools (e.g. wiki,
tickets). To confuse matters, Mercurial repositories comes bundled with
a Trac instance, while you can create free standing Git repositories which
can integrate with the other Assembla components like ticketing.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>&nbsp;</th>
    <th>Repos</th>
    <th>Storage</th>
    <th>Monthly cost</th>
    <th>$/repo</th>
    <th>$/GB</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Free</td>
    <td>&#8734;</td>
    <td>2GB</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>--</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Single</td>
    <td>&#8734; (1)</td>
    <td>2GB</td>
    <td>$24</td>
    <td style="background: #e6efc2;">0</td>
    <td>12</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Group</td>
    <td>&#8734; (10)</td>
    <td>5GB</td>
    <td>$49</td>
    <td style="background: #e6efc2;">0</td>
    <td>9.8</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Professional</td>
    <td>&#8734; (20)</td>
    <td>20GB</td>
    <td>$99</td>
    <td style="background: #e6efc2;">0</td>
    <td>4.95</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Enterprise</td>
    <td>&#8734; (200)</td>
    <td>50GB</td>
    <td>$249</td>
    <td style="background: #e6efc2;">0</td>
    <td>4.98</td>
  </tr>
</table>

In Assembla one *space* can have several repositories.
Similar to Codebase's restrictions on *projects* Assembla has restrictions
on how many *spaces* are allowed for each plan. The parenthesized numbers
in the "Repos" column represents this limitation.

The free Assembla account don't support Mercurial repositories, only Git.

#### [SSH Control][]

The simplest offering in this comparison. Provides you with a web interface
for managing repositories, users, and SSH keys.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>&nbsp;</th>
    <th>Repos</th>
    <th>Storage</th>
    <th>Monthly cost</th>
    <th>$/repo</th>
    <th>$/GB</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Free</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0.003GB</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>--</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Basic</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>0.2GB</td>
    <td>$4.75</td>
    <td>0.60</td>
    <td style="background: #fbe3e4;">23.75</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Premium</td>
    <td>32</td>
    <td>1GB</td>
    <td>$9.75</td>
    <td>0.30</td>
    <td>9.75</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Git

#### [Github][]

Probably the most popular provider for private repositories in this
comparison. The level of mind share which makes Github great for collaborating
on public repositories becomes moot when working on private repositories.
Provides the nicest repository browser of the bunch, but their issue tracker
is arguably not that great.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>&nbsp;</th>
    <th>Repos</th>
    <th>Storage</th>
    <th>Monthly cost</th>
    <th>$/repo</th>
    <th>$/GB</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Micro</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>0.6GB</td>
    <td>$7</td>
    <td>1.40</td>
    <td>11.67</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Small</td>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>1.2GB</td>
    <td>$12</td>
    <td>1.20</td>
    <td>10</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Medium</td>
    <td>20</td>
    <td>2.4GB</td>
    <td>$22</td>
    <td>1.10</td>
    <td>9.17</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Large</td>
    <td>50</td>
    <td>6GB</td>
    <td>$50</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>8.33</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Mega</td>
    <td>125</td>
    <td>20GB</td>
    <td>$125</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>6.25</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Giga</td>
    <td>300</td>
    <td>60GB</td>
    <td>$300</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>5</td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### [Unfuddle][]

Provides a well integrated set of tools including a repository browser, ticket
system with milestones, time tracking and wiki like *notebook* pages.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>&nbsp;</th>
    <th>Repos</th>
    <th>Storage</th>
    <th>Monthly cost</th>
    <th>$/repo</th>
    <th>$/GB</th>

  <tr>
    <td>Micro</td>
    <td>&#8734; (4/4)</td>
    <td>0.5GB</td>
    <td>$9</td>
    <td style="background: #e6efc2;">0</td>
    <td>18</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Compact</td>
    <td>&#8734; (10/10)</td>
    <td>2GB</td>
    <td>$24</td>
    <td style="background: #e6efc2;">0</td>
    <td>12</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Corporate</td>
    <td>&#8734; (20/20)</td>
    <td>4GB</td>
    <td>$49</td>
    <td style="background: #e6efc2;">0</td>
    <td>12.25</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Enterprise</td>
    <td>&#8734; (50/50)</td>
    <td>10GB</td>
    <td>$99</td>
    <td style="background: #e6efc2;">0</td>
    <td>9.90</td>
  </tr>
</table>

One Unfuddle *project* can have several source code repositories.
While all plans allow for an unlimited number of private repositories,
there are restrictions on both how many *active projects* and
*archived projects* are allowed. The parenthesized numbers in the
"Repos" column represents the limit for active and archived projects
respectively.

#### [Beanstalk][]

Delivering a super slick interface with a repository browser and integration
with third party issue tracking systems. Also includes FTP deployment tools.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>&nbsp;</th>
    <th>Repos</th>
    <th>Storage</th>
    <th>Monthly cost</th>
    <th>$/repo</th>
    <th>$/GB</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Personal</td>
    <td>10</td>
    <td>3GB</td>
    <td>$15</td>
    <td>1.50</td>
    <td>5</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Team</td>
    <td>15</td>
    <td>6GB</td>
    <td>$25</td>
    <td>1.67</td>
    <td>4.17</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Business</td>
    <td>30</td>
    <td>12GB</td>
    <td>$50</td>
    <td>1.67</td>
    <td>4.17</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Corporate</td>
    <td>65</td>
    <td>24GB</td>
    <td>$100</td>
    <td>1.54</td>
    <td>4.17</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Giant</td>
    <td>150</td>
    <td>48GB</td>
    <td>$200</td>
    <td>1.33</td>
    <td>4.17</td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### [Codaset][]

A well integrated set of features including source code browser
with code review support, issue management system with control over
worlflows, wikis, and blogs., 

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>&nbsp;</th>
    <th>Repos</th>
    <th>Storage</th>
    <th>Monthly cost</th>
    <th>$/repo</th>
    <th>$/GB</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Free</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0.2GB</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>--</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Up to 5 Projects</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>1GB</td>
    <td>$5</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>5</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Codaset has an interesting pricing model when you move over 5 private
repositories. For 6 private repositories you pay $0.04/repository per
day. Each repositry includes 200MB of storage. This works out to the
following numbers when calculated up to the thresholds used in the summary
of this article:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Repos</th>
    <th>Storage</th>
    <th>Monthly cost</th>
    <th>$/repo</th>
    <th>$/GB</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>1.6GB</td>
    <td>$9.73</td>
    <td>1.22</td>
    <td>6.08</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>16</td>
    <td>3.2GB</td>
    <td>$19.47</td>
    <td>1.22</td>
    <td>6.08</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>41</td>
    <td>8.2GB</td>
    <td>$49.88</td>
    <td>1.22</td>
    <td>6.08</td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### [XP-Dev][]

Includes a plethora of *project management tools*  (iterations, stories, bugs,
burndown charts, velocity charts, wikis, forums, blogs, and attachments)
in addition to standard repositories with a source browser. If that wasn't
enough they also seem to provide Trac instances. The whole suite seems
quite complex and unpolished.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>&nbsp;</th>
    <th>Repos</th>
    <th>Storage</th>
    <th>Monthly cost</th>
    <th>$/repo</th>
    <th>$/GB</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Pro Small</td>
    <td>&#8734;</td>
    <td>1GB</td>
    <td>$5</td>
    <td style="background: #e6efc2;">0</td>
    <td>5</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Pro Medium</td>
    <td>&#8734;</td>
    <td>4GB</td>
    <td>$15</td>
    <td style="background: #e6efc2;">0</td>
    <td>3.75</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>

    <td>$200</td>
    <td style="background: #e6efc2;">0</td>
    <td style="background: #e6efc2;">2</td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### [Indefero][]

A hosted version of an [open source clone][indefero-oss] of [Google Code][].
Provides the same features as the original Google product (e.g. source browser,
issue tracker, code review, and documentation pages).

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>&nbsp;</th>
    <th>Repos</th>
    <th>Storage</th>
    <th>Monthly cost</th>
    <th>$/repo</th>
    <th>$/GB</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Simple</td>
    <td>50</td>
    <td>0.01GB</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>--</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Business</td>
    <td>&#8734;</td>
    <td>1GB</td>
    <td>$6.28 (&#163;49/y)</td>
    <td style="background: #e6efc2;">0</td>
    <td>6.28</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Enterprise</td>
    <td>&#8734;</td>
    <td>5GB</td>
    <td>$25.52 (&#163;199/y)</td>
    <td style="background: #e6efc2;">0</td>
    <td>5.10</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Indefero has to be paid on a yearly basis in British pounds. Monthly costs
used in the comparison were calculated from this yearly cost.

### Mercurial

#### [Bitbucket][]

The most popular Mercurial offering. Seen by some as a copy of Github, but I
think we've [settled that][github-vs-bitbucket]. Provides a source code
browser and a fairly decent issue manager in addition to a wiki system.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>&nbsp;</th>
    <th>Repos</th>
    <th>Storage</th>
    <th>Monthly cost</th>
    <th>$/repo</th>
    <th>$/GB</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Free</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1GB</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>--</td>
    <td>--</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Amateur</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>2.5GB</td>
    <td>$5</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td style="background: #e6efc2;">2</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Pro</td>
    <td>15</td>
    <td>5GB</td>
    <td>$12</td>
    <td>0.8</td>
    <td>2.4</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Large</td>
    <td>25</td>
    <td>26GB</td>
    <td>$50</td>
    <td style="background: #fbe3e4;">2</td>
    <td style="background: #e6efc2;">1.9</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Team</td>
    <td>150</td>
    <td>50GB</td>
    <td>$100</td>
    <td>0.67</td>
    <td style="background: #e6efc2;">2</td>
  </tr>
</table>

#### [Kiln][]

A fairly new product from [Fog Creek Software][] which features a fairly
advances repository browser, code review capabilities, and integration
with [FogBugz][] if you need a bug tracker.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Repos</th>
    <th>Storage</th>
    <th>Monthly cost</th>
    <th>$/repo</th>
    <th>$/GB</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>&#8734;</td>
    <td>&#8734;</td>
    <td>$25</td>
    <td style="background: #e6efc2;">0</td>
    <td style="background: #e6efc2;">0</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Kiln segments its plans based on the number of users one needs. For this
comparison I've used the price of one user.
There are no restrictions on how much storage you can use in Kiln provided
that you don't do anything overly abusive (like
[using it for video storage][kiln-storage]).

#### [Active State Firefly][]

Part of their suite seems to be based on Trac. In addition to a source
browser, wiki, and tickets they provide time time tracking, burndown charts,
forums, and blogs.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>&nbsp;</th>
    <th>Repos</th>
    <th>Storage</th>
    <th>Monthly cost</th>
    <th>$/repo</th>
    <th>$/GB</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Solo</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0.5GB</td>
    <td>$9</td>
    <td style="background: #fbe3e4;">9</td>
    <td style="background: #fbe3e4;">18</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Professional</td>
    <td>5</td>
    <td>1.5GB</td>
    <td>$19</td>
    <td style="background: #fbe3e4;">3.80</td>
    <td>12.67</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Team</td>
    <td>30</td>
    <td>3GB</td>
    <td>$39</td>
    <td>1.30</td>
    <td>13</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Conclusion

For my own needs I'm only interested in the providers which don't impose
restrictions on the amount of private repositories. This eliminates
SSH Control, Github, Beanstalk, Codaset, Bitbucket, and Active State Firefly.

I've ranked the remaining contenders based on how much storage you
get for your buck within three price categories:

#### Free

1. Assembla Free: 2GB
2. Unfuddle Free: 0.2GB
3. Codebase Free: 0.02GB

#### Up to $10/month

1. Repository Hosting 6GB: $1.67/GB
2. XP-Dev Pro Small: $5/GB 
3. Indefero Business: $6.28/GB

#### Up to $20/month

1. Repository Hosting 16GB: $1.25/GB
2. XP-Dev Pro Medium: $3.75/GB

#### Up to $50/month

1. Kiln (one user): Approaching $0/GB
1. Repository Hosting 46GB: $1.09/GB
5. Xp-Dev Enterprise Small: $2.50/GB

Kiln is obviously the most affordable solution if you're planning to store
lots of data, but can get pricey due to the per user pricing model if
you're working in a team.

Due to the restrictions on maximum allowed active *projects* or *spaces*
you should probably ignore Codebase, Assembla, Unfuddle if you use project
management features (e.g. ticketing, wikis, time tracking) together
with each private repository.

I myself have signed up with both [Kiln][] and [Repository Hosting][] so that I can
evaluate both more in depth.
